Chrome extension randomly up votes posts and comments

As a developer account to publish on Chrome Webstore is paid, I have not added this on the Chrome Webstore.

To install and use on Chrome add it as an unpacked extension:
  1. Go to Chrome Settings > Extensions
  2. Toggle the 'Developer mode' switch on the top
  3. Click 'Load unpacked'
  4. Select the extension folder
